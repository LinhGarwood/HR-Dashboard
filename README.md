# HR Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Human Resources Data using Power BI. I employed exploratory data analysis techniques and will utilize DAX to create impactful visualizations. By delving into demographic details, attrition rates, salary insights, and job satisfaction metrics, the aim is to pinpoint factors influencing attrition. Ultimately, this analysis will enable the organization to strategize ways to enhance employee retention.
